# Performance Analysis: MongoDB vs Elasticsearch

## Test Environment
- Spring Boot application connecting to MongoDB and Elasticsearch
- Database size: ~100K orders, ~200 product configurations
- Test method: 10 consecutive requests to each endpoint, measuring total and average response time
- Date: April 2, 2025

## Performance Results

### MongoDB Implementations

| Implementation | Avg. Response Time (ms) | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------|
| MongoDB (distinct) | 66 | Uses `distinct` operator directly on MongoDB collection |
| MongoDB (optimized) | 885 | Custom optimized query approach |
| MongoDB (with hint) | 11,967 | Uses index hints, performed similarly to standard query |
| MongoDB (standard) | 12,026 | Baseline implementation |

### Elasticsearch Implementations

| Implementation | Avg. Response Time (ms) | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Elasticsearch (repository) | 547 | Spring Data Elasticsearch repository pattern |
| Elasticsearch (simple) | 2,451 | Custom implementation using model classes with custom deserializer |
| Elasticsearch (manual) | 2,587 | Uses JsonData for manual deserialization, avoiding model classes |

## Analysis

1. **MongoDB's Distinct Operator**: The clear performance winner is MongoDB's distinct query approach, which was ~8x faster than the best Elasticsearch method. This shows that MongoDB's distinct operator is highly optimized for this specific use case.

2. **Elasticsearch Repository Pattern**: Among Elasticsearch approaches, the repository pattern significantly outperformed custom implementations. This suggests Spring Data Elasticsearch's built-in optimizations are quite effective.

3. **Index Hint Ineffectiveness**: The MongoDB "with hint" approach showed no improvement over the standard approach, suggesting that the chosen hint might not be optimal or that MongoDB's query optimizer already chooses the best execution plan.

4. **Deserialization Cost**: Custom implementations in Elasticsearch that handled flexible date formats came with a performance cost. Manual JSON handling was approximately 5x slower than using the repository pattern.

## Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Date Format Compatibility**: We implemented a custom `FlexibleLocalDateTimeDeserializer` to handle both date-only and date-time formats from Elasticsearch, which significantly improved reliability.

2. **Query Optimization**: We explored multiple query strategies for both MongoDB and Elasticsearch to identify the most efficient approaches.

## Recommendations

1. **For Real-time Queries**: Use MongoDB's distinct query approach when performance is critical.

2. **For Elasticsearch**: 
   - Stick with the repository pattern when possible 
   - Use custom deserializers only when necessary for format compatibility
   - Consider batch operations for large datasets

3. **Data Format Consistency**: Standardize on consistent date formats across systems to avoid deserialization overhead.

4. **Multi-database Strategy**: 
   - MongoDB for fast, real-time queries requiring precise results
   - Elasticsearch for complex search scenarios, full-text search, and analytics

## Technical Implementation Notes

The performance improvements were achieved through:

1. Custom date format handling with Jackson annotations
2. Optimized query patterns for both databases
3. Direct use of database-specific operators (MongoDB distinct)
4. Custom JsonData approach to avoid model-based deserialization when needed
